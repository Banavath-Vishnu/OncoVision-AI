# 🧠 OncoVision AI

### AI-Powered Breast Ultrasound Classification System

OncoVision AI is an end-to-end deep learning system that classifies breast ultrasound images into **Benign**, **Malignant**, and **Normal** categories.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is developed for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended for clinical or diagnostic use.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Early detection plays a critical role in breast cancer survival rates. Many AI startups today are building medical imaging systems to assist radiologists with faster and more consistent screening.

OncoVision AI explores the engineering foundations behind such systems by:

* Training a CNN-based image classifier
* Handling dataset imbalance
* Improving inference robustness
* Deploying a real-time prediction web application
